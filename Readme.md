This is my repository for the peer graded assignment. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on data for human activity.

Codebook is a guide that describes the variables, the data, and work that I did to clean the data
    
Script Analysis performs the data preparation that is inspired by the project's rules:
        
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidy.txt is the the file that is exported so that it is able to be read out of RStudio.
